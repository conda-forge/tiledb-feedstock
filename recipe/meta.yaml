  patches:
    # This patch removes the find_package(LZ4) call and falls back to the pre-vcpkg
    # mechanism of using find_library.
    # The lz4 Conda package does not export CMake targets, and the vcpkg port uses
    # a custom CMakeLists.txt, dating from before an official one was introduced.
    # Moreover, the upstream lz4 exports separate static/shared targets and uses
    # a different casing of the target's name from vcpkg.
    # After lz4 publishes a unified CMake target with https://github.com/lz4/lz4/pull/1372,
    # we will have to align Conda, vcpkg and TileDB, and then we can remove this patch.

  summary: TileDB sparse and dense multi-dimensional array data management
  description: |
    TileDB is an efficient multi-dimensional array management system which introduces
    a novel on-disk format that can effectively store dense and sparse array data with
    support for fast updates and reads. It features excellent compression, and an efficient
    parallel I/O system with high scalability.
